    "* Data science involves using scientific tools, algorithms and data models to statistically analyse and extract knowledge from large volumes of processed/unprocessed collected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mathematically, an object can be represented in 2 ways:\n",
    "  * Object Representation: To depict isolated objects like vectors (words in a document), sequences (DNA), etc.\n",
    "  * Network Represenation: To show interaction among objects like graphs (friendship network, road connections), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most common representation for documents is called 'bag of words' representation. \n",
    "  * First the document sentences are tokenized. \n",
    "  * Then their base forms are derived via stemming and lemmatization.\n",
    "  * The collected lexemes are then converted to n-gram or skip gram model. As n increases, the size of word dictionary and thus, the memory required to store it increases but contextual information is captured more efficiently.\n",

    "Edit Distance is defined as the minimum number of specific kinds of operations (each with a mentioned cost) required to modify an object of a class to another object of the same class. The objectve is to minimise the cost associated with edit distance while modifying an entity. The higher the edit distance, the higher is the difference or between the entities.\n",

    "1. a) $d(x,x)=0$\\\n",
    "This is trivial as minimum number of operations (and cost) to change string x to x is 0.\\\n",

    "Consider the cost required to update x to y (or edit distance of x,y) is $c$. We can argue that the minimum cost required to update y to x is $c$ by replacing insertion with deletion, deletion with insertion for $d(y,x)$\n",
    "3. $d(x,y)+d(y,z)\\geq d(x,z)$\\\n",
    "Let $d(x,y)=c_1\\;,\\; d(y,z)=c_2$. We can argue that $d(x,y)+d(y,z)< d(x,z)$ is FALSE. This can be done by contradiction. \\\n",

    "However, we can easily argue that we can update x to z by updating x to y and then update y to z. Since edit distance gives the minimum number of operations associated with cost, d(x,z) is maximum $c_1+c_2$. Therefore our assumption is wrong.\\\n",
